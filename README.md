# Reinforcement Learning with Deep Q-Network for Demon Attack Game

---

This is an implementation of Reinforcement Learning using Deep Q-Networks for the Atari game called Demon Attack. The environment was obtained from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari). Image processing was conducted using PyTorch framework. Outputs from this experiment include score and history comparisons between the trained agent and random actions, the model from the trained agent, as well as video recordings showcasing the performance of both the trained agent and random actions.

The code used here is sourced from various references, primarily from https://github.com/qarchli/dqn-on-space-invaders. However, extensive modifications were made to streamline the code, enhance processing speed, and improve outcomes. Moreover, the encountered challenges differed, necessitating unique approaches that might not align with the original implementation.
